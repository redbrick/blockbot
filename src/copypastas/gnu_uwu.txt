I'd just like to interject for a moment uwu What you are referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNyU/Linux, or as I've recentwy taken to cawwing it, GNyU pwus Linyux. Linyux is nyot an opewating system unto itsewf, but wathew anyothew fwee componyent of a fuwwy functionying GNyU system made usefuw by the GNyU cowewibs, sheww utiwities and vitaw system componyents compwising a fuww OS as definyed by POSIX. Many computew usews wun a modified vewsion of the GNyU system evewy day, without weawizing it. Thwough a pecuwiaw tuwn of events, the vewsion of GNyu which is widewy used today is often cawwed "Linyux", and many of its usews awe nyot awawe that it is basicawwy the GNyU system, devewoped by the GNyu Pwoject. Thewe weawwy is a Linyux, and these peopwe awe using it, but it is just a pawt of the system they use. Linyux is the kewnyew: the pwogwam in the system that awwocates the machinye's wesouwces to the othew pwogwams that you wun. The kewnyew is an essentiaw pawt of an opewating system, but usewess by itsewf; it can onwy function in the context of a compwete opewating system. Linyux is nyowmawwy used in combinyation with the GNyU opewating system: the whowe system is basicawwy GNyU with Linyux added, ow GNyU/Linyux. Aww the so-cawwed "Linyux" distwibutions awe weawwy distwibutions of GNyU/Linyux.
